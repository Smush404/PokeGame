# Description
An ACII game a lot like Pokemon.

## Usage

```zsh
% make
# This makes the executable file "poke327"

% ./poke327 <file name> 
# EXSAMPLE ./poke327 moves.csv
# This runs the program with the file name that should be printed to the screen
```

## BUGS
1) not really a bug but formating is off becuase it just for debuging and I dont have the time of day to make a million formating methods. 

2) if it can not find the database it will tell you that it can not other then that the pathing on the server makes no sense to me i did my best. the important thing is that the datbase should build if the CSV files are found.
